      "These boys of the endless, infernal summer have taught me a lot about the 1990 Cincinnati Reds and America's favorite pastime. I learned that 'Billy Hatcher' has always mistaken Mercury for the Carvaggio painting where Judas betrays Jesus. That 'Mariano Duncan' was once a young Colombian girl with six arms to crush the wild and the wicked and the pure-hearted alike. That the real 'Lou Piniella' is a baby black snake ensnared in the talons of a Cooper's hawk, and while he was being fed to the hawk's hatchlings, he was filming a car dealership commercial with Ozzie Guill√©n. That 'Chris Sabo' drove a brown 1988 Ford Escort." 
      -Mr. Frank Capra

      Christopher is a boy who lives outdoors in North Philadelphia, near Polish Springs and the Outpost. These tracks are based on or are readings from his scripture. They were recorded in December 2010 immediately after completion of Clam Date, and mixed in January after setting up shop on the 'Cherokee Mile'. Exactly three muses sat on the throne and under the curtain. Certain tracks are here in public. Download includes full 90 minute album, the original credits and scripture excerpt, 34 drawings, and a tiny palmful of additional tracks from the time period. The original release was limited to 30 copies or so. Singular J-cards were hand drawn. The files of drawings included with the download serve as examples from the same time period. Additional tracks include two covers: one from a split with J. Zagers and the other from a split with Nightburger (now Profligate), as well as an extended Scripture track and a submission from the Tape Fantasy vol II compilation featuring tape samples and modifications of poet / saxophonist Alex Hampshire sources. Christopher Scripture was originally intended as the soundtrack to 'untitled moving picture no 1 2010' by Wendy Hyatt, Rick Weaver, Larva Lu, Christine Jones, Kevin Esposito, Tomas Bennett, & J.G. Harris. January 2011
